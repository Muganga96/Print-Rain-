      <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Programming is the process of designing and building executable computer software to accomplish a specific task.
      </p>
      It enables the automation of tasks, solving of problems, and creation of applications and systems that perform complex operations.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4>Basics Of Programming</h4>
      <p>
        Languages: Programming is done using various languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, etc. Each language has its own syntax and use cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Syntax: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered to be correctly structured programs in a language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Code: Instructions written by a programmer in a specific programming language.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Development Process</h3>
      <h4>Writing Code: </h4>
      <p>
        Using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
      </p>
      <h4>Testing:</h4>
      <p>
        Running the code to ensure it works as expected.
      </p>
      <h4>Debugging.</h4>
      <p>
        Identifying and fixing errors in the code.
      </p>
      <h4>Compiling/Interpreting:</h4>
      <p>
        Converting code into machine-readable format. Compilers translate the entire program before execution, whereas interpreters translate code line-by-line during execution.
      </p>
      <h4>Version Control:</h4>
      <p>
        Using systems like Git to manage changes to the codebase.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Common Paradigms</h3>
      <h4>Procedural Programming: </h4>
      <p>
        Based on procedure calls; includes languages like C.
      </p>
      <h4>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h4>
      <p>
        Based on the concept of "objects"; includes languages like Java and Python.
      </p>
      <h4>Functional Programming::</h4>
      <p>
        Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions; includes languages like Haskell and Lisp.
